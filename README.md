# Guitar Hero-Style Rhythm Game

Welcome to our open-source rhythm game project, inspired by Guitar Hero. This project aims to create an engaging rhythm game where players hit notes that match the rhythm of a song. This README provides all the necessary information to get started with setting up and contributing to the project.

## Features

- **Dynamic Note Generation**: Notes are generated based on pre-defined song patterns and appear in a variety of columns across the screen.
- **Real-Time Audio Playback**: Syncs gameplay with audio tracks, playing corresponding notes and rhythms.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks user input accuracy and scores based on timing and precision.
- **Adjustable Difficulty Levels**: Supports multiple difficulty settings that affect the speed and frequency of notes.

### Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler or any compatible C/C++ compiler
- Make (for building the project)
